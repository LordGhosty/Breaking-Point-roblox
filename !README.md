  <summary>Description for each.</summary>
    <p>→ Display: Let's you use the second display emote, which was available only with the VIP pass of the game which well got deleted.</p>
    <p>→ Galaxy: Gives you the Galaxy chair, a limited item. It won't be available in your inventory but everywhere towards the server. The game also saves its existence meaning you gotta execute this script only once in order to have the chair. If you change it  you need to re execute it.</p>
    <p>→ Stellar: Same as Galaxy ( ↑ ) </p>
    <p>→ Royal Red: Unlike the other two (Galaxy,Stellar) this one is actually obtainable. But in order to make it obtainable without the system banning you from trades though of making the with their actual in-game token value. This prevents ban and includes the time within your inventory (10.000 points)</p>
    <p>→ Antlers Case: Gives you access to a limited Case. (10.000 points)</p>
    <p>→ Candy Crown: Limited access to a knife that has pretty much been deleted.</p>
    <p>→ Emote E-rain: Gives you an emote called E-rain which gets activated when you type e/ rain in the chat. (3 points)</p>
  
**Something i must add is this i never found a way to make the scripts to stop to a certain level. Keep this in mind before executing any of the scripts that use credits/points. The scripts will stop only when they cant be executed anymore meaning that you ran out of the needed points.**

    <summary>Things that might be added, might not be tho.</summary>
    <p>→ Rumors have it that there is a purple knife only the developer of the game had access too. Ive seen the file my self in the explorer but never was able to make a script to retrieve it. If i do tho it will be added in the list.</p>
    <p>→ Do never expect this list to include any kind of infinite points/credits scripts. Those never get executed as expected and they can cause trade ban or ip ban.</p>
